        <h1>What is GIC</h1>
        <p>GIC was established on August 2, 2010. GIC coordinates the work of</p>
          <p>(i) GTU’s Student Start-up Support System (S4) established on 25 rd February 2012,<br />
          (ii) study of IPR instituted from 3 September 2011,<br />
          (iii) the S4 Co-Creation Center (S4-C3) established on May 1, 2013,<br />
          (iv) GTU’s ShodhYatras and (v) the structure of GTU Innovation Sankuls.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">GIC is one of the most active University Innovation entities and S4-C3 continues to serve the students and alumni 24/7, all through the year.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">GTU established GTU Innovation Council (GIC) to felicitate student startups by providing necessary facilities, organizing workshops, helping student to find relevant mentors and other activities weekly. GIC also conducts workshops on training the professors, social entrepreneurship boot camp, design thinking and ideation workshop. It established a separate wing of IP Clinic which helps students to easily patent their innovative ideas and projects. Its first objective is to nurture creativity and innovation within the University community. It has been designed to act as a catalyst of change for the whole of the society. The Council is sending out its students, teachers to businesses, industries and various organizations to continuously prepare projects and case studies for changes, which may lead to improvement in products and processes. When 400,000 students and 27,000 students start working as a force, we expect that the education and research will be rejuvenated through anchoring it with the real-life problems. It has set up 25 Innovation Sankuls, which are regional communities of GTU educational institutions and industries in the region.</p>
          
          <p><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong><br />
          • Create User Defined Innovation Eco-system.<br />
          • Mapping of Industrial Needs and Academic research, Exchanging mentors from industry and<br />
          academia/formal and informal domain.<br />
          • Distributing and democratizing innovation management process by creating 300 innovation centers.<br />
          • Industry-Academia cluster development involving industrial estates and GTU colleges.<br />
          • Creating sustainable motivation for students and researchers to scale the output.<br />
          • Harness collaborative potential of students across disciplines and colleges.<br />
          • Developing Relay Model of innovation and student entrepreneurship module development at very early stage.<br />
          • Emphasis on process innovation and Socializing Technologies.<br />
          • Protecting IPR, Intellectual property rights and promoting knowledge economy along with innovations.<br />
          • Promoting Frugal/Gandhian Innovations exclusively in Diploma Education Ecosystem.<br />
          • Harnessing the numerous months of efforts of research for productive innovation creation by young technical students and faculties by vertical integration of skills, time and existing resources.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>S4 (Student Startup Support System):</strong><br> Due to insufficient understanding of the needs of the universities of today, the administrative systems of the government fail to provide the necessary facilities or financial autonomy to their State universities. However time does not stop moving ahead till our society understands the requirements of its State Universities. Hence in spite of the handicaps, the universities must continue to serve the needs of the young. GTU, therefore, has set up an entrepreneurship.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">sensitization program, pre-incubator boot-camps, a very active Student Start-up Support System (S4), a working  space for budding entrepreneurs called S4- CoCreation Center (S4-C3), a highly active IPR Cell, which has trained about 4,400 Faculty Members about basics of patenting and which helps students and Faculty Members to apply for patents through its Patent Clinics and a Facility like the Tinkering Lab of Cornell or the Fab Lab of MIT for students and alumni to develop products of interest to them in after- hours and on holidays. To manage all these activities, GTU Innovation Council (GIC) has been set up and it is today by far the most active innovation council in India.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Innovation Sankuls:</strong><br> Through GTU Innovation Sankuls, GTU has created a structure so that the Colleges can develop a close relationship with the industries. Today more than 70% of the Final Year projects at GTU are based upon problems from MSMEs. Moreover the industries are invited in every semester of the Final Year to an Open House exhibition of the students’ work and the industry professionals are asked to evaluate the Final Year projects.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CiC3 (Community Innovation & Co-Creation Centre):</strong><br> On 1st May 2013, a common laboratory, where students and alumni can work to develop their own products, was also established in a 1,500 sq ft of space adjoining S4-C3; The Lab is available after-hours and on holidays; It has a stream of mentors and geeks from the local community; The Lab is called Community-innovation-Co-Creation Center (C-i-C3); C-i-C3 is designed to have facilities like those in the tinkering lab of Cornell University plus the Fab lab of MIT. C-i-C3 is a part of the Sankul movement. Each C-i-C3 is responsible for supporting the activities under the following areas:</p>
          
          <p>a) S4 Extension Centers<br />
          
          b) Hardware Design Innovation Co-Creation Center<br />
          
          c) Open Source Technology Clubs<br />
          
          d) Mobile Technologies Clubs</p>
          
          <p>As the Lab attracts progressively greater usage by the students, the University will add modern facilities like 3 D printers, 3 D scanners etc for fabrication of prototypes by students GTU proposes to establish C-i-C3s during 2014-15. It proposes to establish 15 more C-iC3 in 2015-16 so that each one of the 25 Sankuls will have one. This will provide facilities for a student or alumni to have facilities for developing a product all across the State.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IPR (Intellectual Property Rights):</strong><br> During the last three years, GTU has conducted 43 different workshops on Patent and IPR issues. 4,421 Faculty Members and a large number of students have participated in these workshops. B.8.1 Boot-camps and Hands-on workshops for faculty members for Patenting in Engineering &amp; Pharmaceutical science: launched on Sept 3, 2011 and designed to give exposure about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and various associated instruments, which can be used to protect IPR at various stages of innovation: Till now, 4,421 Faculty Members in Engineering and Pharmaceutical sciences have been trained through this program.</p>
